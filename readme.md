A lot of people have been asking me about problems concerning the proper usage of Greek Characters in JDK and Netbeans 8.2.
Problems are arisen for users every time they try to print Unicode fonts(Greek chars) on the output window and with using the Scanner command that appears to
some to be unicode agnostic.
I searched into the internet and found a lot of not working solutions.
My solution has been testd on:
* Netbeans 8.2 + JDK 1.8
